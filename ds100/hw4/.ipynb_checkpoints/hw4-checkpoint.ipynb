    "## This Assignment\n",
    "In this homework, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

    "After this homework, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data\n",
    "- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimize overfitting\n",
    "- Generating and analyzing precision recall curves\n",
    "\n",
    "## Warning\n",
    "We've tried our best to filter the data for anything blatantly offensive as best as we can, but unfortunately there may still be some examples you may find in poor taste. If you encounter these examples and believe it is inappropriate for students, please let a TA know and we will try to remove it for future semesters. Thanks for your understanding!\n",

    "When the feature is binary, it makes sense (as in the previous question) to compare the proportion of 1s in the two classes of email. Otherwise, if the feature can take on many values, it makes sense to compare the distribution under spam to the distribution under ham. Create a *class conditional density plot* like the one below (which was created using `sns.distplot`), comparing the distribution of a feature among all spam emails to the distribution of the same feature among all ham emails. You should use your training set (after splitting). **You may use the length of the email body or create your own feature.** If using length of the email body, please set the xlim to 50000.\n",

In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the test set. To see your accuracy on the test set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `test` DataFrame and upload your predictions to Kaggle.\n",

    "# Question 9 (Making a Precision-Recall Curve)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can trade off between precision and recall. In most cases we won't be able to get both perfect precision (i.e. no false positives) and recall (i.e. no false negatives), so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision-recall curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, [plot a precision-recall curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html#plot-the-precision-recall-curve) for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle)."
